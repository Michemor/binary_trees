# 0x1D. C - Binary trees
#### C GROUP PROJECT ALGORITHM DATA STRUCTURES

## Learning Objectives
1. What is a binary tree
A binary tree is an example of a tree data structure that has at most two children.
As a result each node on the tree can have 0, 1 or 2 children.
2. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
A binary tree has no specific structure on the insertion of nodes. For a Binary Search <br>
tree, each node less than the parent node has to be inserted to the left while those <br>
greater than the parent node have to be inserted to the right.
3. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
4. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
The depth of a tree refers to the longest path from the root node to that particular node <br>
or to the leaf node.
The height refers to the number of nodes from a leaf node to the root node or any particular <br>
 node on the tree.
5. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
Inorder traversal
Preorder traversal
Postorder traversal
6. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
